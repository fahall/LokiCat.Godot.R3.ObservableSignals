## Overview

This project provides a **Roslyn source generator** that automatically creates [R3](https://github.com/Cysharp/R3) observable extensions for each signal exposed by the [`Chickensoft.GodotNodeInterfaces`](https://github.com/chickensoft-games/godot-node-interfaces) interfaces.

You get strongly typed, composable observables that make it easy to work with Godot signals in a reactive way using R3.

### Why bother?

1. We want to program to Interfaces (see: [Chickensoft.GodotNodeInterfaces](https://github.com/chickensoft-games/GodotNodeInterfaces))
2. We want to use Reactive X style Observables for signal management (see: [R3](https://github.com/Cysharp/R3) )
3. [R3](https://github.com/Cysharp/R3) provides a limited set of preconfigured Observable wrappers
4. LokiCat.GodotNodeInterfaces.Observables: Now we can have Rx & program to interfaces without having to write wrappers every time!

Lets look at an example:

Lets say you have a menu that uses a button `IBaseButton`, and you want to use an Observable for the `Toggled` signal of that button.

#### Pure C# Events w/ GodotNodeInterface
* :white_check_mark: We get the behavior we want. 
2. :x: We have to manage the subscription and unsubscription ourselves. 
3. :x: We want ReactiveX

```csharp
public partial class MyMenu : Control, IControl {
    
    private IBaseButton doSomethingButton;

    public void OnReady() {
       doSomethingButton.Pressed += DoSomething;
    }
    
    public void OnExitTree() {
        // We have to remember to unsubscribe. 
        // Not difficult, but easy to forget when managing behavior in multiple places.
        doSomething.Pressed -= DoSomething;    
    }
    
    private void DoSomething(bool isToggledOn) { /* Do stuff */ }
}
```

#### Using an R3 Observable
Here, we're using R3 to manually wrap our events into Observables

* :white_check_mark: We get the behavior we want.
* :white_check_mark: Only manage it in one place
* :white_check_mark: We have ReactiveX
* :x: Observable takes quite a few lines to setup
* :x: Some of the Godot EventHandler types involve more casting than this example.

```csharp
public partial class MyMenu : Control, IControl {
    
    private IBaseButton doSomethingButton;
    
    public void OnReady() {
       Observable.FromEvent<ToggledEventHandler, bool>(
           h => (toggledOn) => h(toggledOn), // We could use a lambda here, if we wanted.
           h => doSomethingButton.Toggled += h,
           h => doSomethingButton.Toggled -= h,
           cancellationToken // Optional
       ).Subscribe(DoSomething)
       .AddTo(this); // Cleanup happens here now. Yay!
    }
    
    private void DoSomething(bool isToggledOn) { /* Do stuff */ }
}
```

#### Using LokiCat.GodotNodeInterfaces.Observables
* :white_check_mark: We get the behavior we want.
* :white_check_mark: Only manage it in one place
* :white_check_mark: We have ReactiveX
* :white_check_mark: Observables ready-to-use
* :white_check_mark: No explicit casting to fiddle with or extra code to write
* :white_check_mark: We can use lambdas too!

```csharp
public partial class MyMenu : Control, IControl {
    
    private IBaseButton doSomethingButton;
    
    public void OnReady() {
       doSomethingButton.OnPressedAsObservable() 
           .Subscribe(DoSomething) 
           .AddTo(this); 
    }
    
    private void DoSomething(bool isToggledOn) { /* Do stuff */ }
}

```

## ✨ Features

- 🔧 **Zero config**: Just install the package and observe away.
- ⚡ **Automatic discovery** of all signals defined in `Chickensoft.GodotNodeInterfaces`.
- 🧪 Fully tested generator logic.
- 🧵 Handles custom delegate signal types (like `ButtonPressedEventHandler`).
- 📦 Designed for `.NET 7+`, compatible with Godot 4.x C# projects.

---

## 📦 Installation

Install via NuGet:

```bash
dotnet add package LokiCat.GodotNodeInterfaces.Observables
```

---

## 🔌 Usage

No setup is required. Once the package is installed, the source generator will run during build and add extension methods for each interface's signals.

You can observe any Godot signal (from the Chickensoft interfaces) like so:

```csharp
public partial class MyNode : Node2D {
  public override void _Ready() {
    this.OnPressedAsObservable()
      .Subscribe(_ => GD.Print("Pressed!"));
  }
}
```

The method name pattern is:

```csharp
On[SignalName]AsObservable()
```

These methods are automatically added to the interface types like `IButton`, `IArea2D`, etc.

Each observable uses the signal's native delegate (including custom Godot signal delegate types), and returns `Observable<T>` where `T` is:

- The signal parameter type (if 1 parameter)
- A tuple `(T1, T2, ...)` (if multiple parameters)
- `Unit` (if no parameters)

---

## 🧪 Examples

### Observing `Pressed` from `IButton`

```csharp
button.OnPressedAsObservable()
  .Subscribe(_ => GD.Print("Button was pressed"));
```

### Observing `MouseEntered` from `IArea2D`

```csharp
area.OnMouseEnteredAsObservable()
  .Subscribe(_ => ShowTooltip());
```

### Observing complex signal with parameters

For a signal like:

```csharp
event InputEventEventHandler(Godot.Node viewport, Godot.InputEvent @event, long shapeIdx);
```

Generated observable extension:

```csharp
collision.OnInputEventAsObservable()
  .Subscribe(tuple => {
    var (viewport, evt, shapeIdx) = tuple;
    GD.Print($"Input received on shape {shapeIdx}");
  });
```

### Composing observables with R3

```csharp
button.OnPressedAsObservable()
  .ThrottleFirst(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(500))
  .Subscribe(_ => GD.Print("Throttled click!"));
```

## ⚙️ Dependencies

- [.NET 7+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0)
- [R3](https://github.com/Cysharp/R3)
- [Chickensoft.GodotNodeInterfaces](https://github.com/chickensoft-games/godot-node-interfaces)

---

## 🧱 How It Works

- Uses Roslyn source generation to discover every `event` declared in `Chickensoft.GodotNodeInterfaces` interfaces.
- Ignores inherited events (to avoid duplicate generation).
- Generates extension methods per event with exact types.
- Handles custom Godot signal delegates with correct constructor/parameter logic.

All source is generated at compile time and added to your build transparently.

---

## 🧪 Tests

Tests cover:

- Events with 0, 1, or many parameters
- Delegates with and without constructors
- Namespace resolution
- Method name and return type formatting

You can run tests locally:

```bash
dotnet test
```

---

## 🛠 Development

To build from source:

```bash
dotnet build -c Release
```

To pack for NuGet:

```bash
dotnet pack -c Release
```
